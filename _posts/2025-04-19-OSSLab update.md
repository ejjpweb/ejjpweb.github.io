# Update: PVK002 Device Removed from ParaSol Platform

**Date: April 19, 2025**

We would like to inform that device coded PVK002 has been removed from the ParaSol platform for real-time power tracking due to significant performance degradation.

## Technical Device Details

The PVK002 was a MAPbI₃-based perovskite solar cell with HTM-free stack configuration and an active area of 0.64 cm². Unfortunately, its performance has steadily declined since its early operational stages.

## Probable Causes of Failure

Initial hypotheses point to:
- Possible deficiencies in the encapsulation procedure
- Failures in the electrode cable attachments to the device

A detailed post-mortem examination will be conducted in the coming days to precisely determine the origin of the problem.

## Comparison with Twin Device

It is important to highlight that a twin device belonging to the BONIFACE project, with identical perovskite chemical composition and differing only in the encapsulation procedure, continues to perform well as shown below:
