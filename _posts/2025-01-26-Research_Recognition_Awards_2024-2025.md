I am pleased to share a series of recognitions our research has received recently highlighting the impact and relevance of our work in sustainable energy and materials science.

### Research Awards

**Re-UNITA Award (June 2024)**
The University of Zaragoza awarded our research through the [Re-UNITA initiative](https://sede.unizar.es/?app=touz&opcion=mostrar&id=61258&origen=buscar), which promotes open access publication in strategic areas including Renewable Energy, Circular Economy, and Cultural Heritage. Our winning publication [Enhanced Power Point Tracking for High Hysteresis Perovskite Solar Cells with a Galvanostatic Approach](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2024.101885) introduces an innovative power-tracking algorithm and cost-effective hardware for perovskite solar cells. This development addresses critical challenges in maximizing power generation from these next-generation solar devices, particularly for stable triple-mesoscopic hole-transport-material-free cells. The research emphasizes practical implementation by providing open-source hardware and software through [GitHub](https://github.com/ej-jp/perovskino) and [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10647187) repositories. The €1,800 award supported the publication of an additional [open-access protocol paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xpro.2024.103394) detailing the assembling and usage of this tracking system, furthering our commitment to open science and technology transfer.

### Project Impact

The BONIFACE project represents a significant advancement in sustainable building technologies, combining environmental benefits with economic innovation. By integrating photovoltaic technology with traditional ceramic materials, the project simultaneously addresses energy efficiency and construction sustainability while creating new market opportunities. This approach not only revitalizes the Spanish ceramic industry but also positions Spain as a leader in building-integrated photovoltaic technology. The project's comprehensive impact extends from reducing CO2 emissions to improving building energy efficiency, ultimately benefiting end-users through reduced energy costs and enhanced thermal comfort.

### Future Directions

These recognitions reinforce our commitment to technology transfer and industrial application of research. The BONIFACE project (CPP2022-009766) exemplifies this approach, bridging academic research with industrial implementation through 2026. Similarly, our development of the Perovskino system demonstrates our dedication to creating practical, open-source solutions that can be readily adopted by the research community and industry partners. This focus on transferable technology and open innovation continues to guide our research strategy, ensuring our scientific advances have direct industrial applications.

### Acknowledgments

Special thanks to our research team members  and collaborators Marta Haro Remón, Roberto Casas, Arturo Sanz Marco, Alberto Lafuente and Cristina Momblona Rincón, as well as our institutional partners at INMA CSIC-University of Zaragoza and the SAMCA Group. These achievements would not be possible without their collaborative effort and support.
