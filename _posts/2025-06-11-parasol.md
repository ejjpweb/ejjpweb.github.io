**Yesterday (June 10th)** we reached **>60Â°C device temperature** for the first time this year at our perovskite solar cell testing platform! ðŸ“ˆ

**Key observations from our weather station data:**

â€¢ PARASOL consistently measures **4-5Â°C higher maximum temperatures** than ambient due to a "pot effect" created by the high walls surrounding our rooftop terrace at the I+D+i building (Universidad de Zaragoza, RÃ­o Ebro Campus)

â€¢ Temperature matching between ambient and device sensors during night time hours with no solar radiation. â˜½

â€¢ Minimum temperatures show no "pot effect" confirming our hypothesis about the terrace microclimate influence

The graphs show 3 days of instant temperatures (device/ambient/chamber storing electronics) plus power irradiation, alongside AEMET maximum, minimum and average temperature data from Zaragoza Airport for comparison.

**The harsh season begins for perovskite cells in Zaragoza!** ðŸ”¥ We'll be watching closely to see if we surpass last year's **66Â°C peak** reached in late July.

This thermal behavior is crucial for understanding real-world performance of our perovskite cells with MPP tracker technology! ðŸ”¬âš¡
